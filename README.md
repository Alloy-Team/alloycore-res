Custom Model Data Formatting
---
As a developer you may notice that there's a certain 6 digit coding in all of our item json overrides. This isn't just erratic and is meant for organization.
An example is 220136.

The two digits at the front (22) represent the "pack ID", as in so-and-so datapack has <> two digit ID.

The middle two digits are a form of sub-grouping. The numbers in the example (01) represents the first sub-group of ID 22.

The last two digits are just numbering. The first model you assign to 2201XX would be 01, and you count up from there. 99 max.
